# TitleTicket Management System


Ticket Management System developed with Node.js and MongoDB. This system empowers users to efficiently manage support tickets through CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). By utilizing Express.js, it showcases the creation of a RESTful API and highlights the seamless integration with MongoDB for database management.


## Features

    - Create new support tickets.
    - Retrieve all support tickets.
    - Retrieve a specific ticket by its unique ID.
    - Update a support ticket by its unique ID.
    - Delete a support ticket by its unique ID.
    - Status for tickets: open, in-progress, closed.
